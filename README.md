### About
Our project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques for the automated detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in videos. Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by challenges in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. Early detection and intervention are crucial for improving outcomes for individuals with ASD.


### Dataset 
We obtained a comprehensive dataset of facial images from publicly available sources such as Kaggle. This dataset contains images of individuals with and without ASD, providing a diverse range of facial expressions and characteristics.


### Pipeline
- Face Detection: Utilizing computer vision techniques (e.g., Haar cascades or deep learning-based face detection models), faces are detected within each frame of the input video.
- ASD Classification: The detected faces are then passed through the trained ASD detection model. This model assigns a probability score to each face, indicating the likelihood of ASD. 
- Visualization: Faces with a high probability of ASD are highlighted or displayed, providing a visual cue to potential areas of concern.
